# Caesar Cipher Javascript Example

A simple web page that demonstrates a Caesar Cipher algorithm

by Andrew Dempsey

Open University TM470 19B

### Overview

Within the Javascript of index.html, there is a variable called "letters". Edit this to any text you would like to encrypt and then run the page. The plaintext along with the cipher text will be displayed.

For example:

"The Open University" becomes "Pqfo!Vojwfstjuz"

### Details

The algorithm will change the unicode value of the plaintext based on a "shift" value that is set in the code. This results in cipher text.
